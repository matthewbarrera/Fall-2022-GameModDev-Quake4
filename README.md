#ProjectMod_v2.0

***Common Deliverables:***
1. A Desktop Shortcut to automatically launch your mod. *(Completed)*
2. A README.md file in your Github repository explaining: *(In-Progress)*
   - What your mod is;
   - What has been changed; and
   - How to test each deliverable.
3. A Modified Main Menu. *(Mostly Completed - Buttons to Open Map and Show Help Screen Not Working)*
4. A Modified Heads-Up Display (HUD) to reflect a key feature of your mod.
5. An In-Game Help Screen explaining your mod changes. *(In-Progress)*

***My Specific Deliverables:***
1. Rhythm-based bonuses (The timer that affects gunplay/damage).
2. Enemies spawning in waves.
3. 5 NPCS that can be summoned and taken over (Monsters that you play as).
4. 5 Custom Pick-ups/Powerups.
5. Change enemy behavior (Of human NPCs) to the music / Give 5 enemies (Human NPCs) abilities.

***Differences between ProjectMod_v1.0 and ProjectMod_v2.0***
- guis (folder) > mainmenu.gui
  - This is where all changes to the main menu are stored and later moved into pak025.pk4.
- savegames (folder) > PulseDropMap.save & PulseDropMap.txt
  - This is the map I want the Open Map Button to access; Currently not being reached.
- game0025.pk4
  - The guis > mainmenu.gui has been modified.
- GUI_InformationNotes.txt
  - Doesn't affect the game; just some notes on how the main menu GUI was changed.
- Quake 4 Shortcut
  - It's important that the files are stored in the proper location! "Target" and "Start In" depend on this.

*Note about all of the files from ProjectMod_v2.0*

*These files are stored in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 4\ProjectMod*

*All future files relating to the mod will likely be added to this folder location*
